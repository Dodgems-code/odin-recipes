    <p>Where do I begin? Muffins. MUFFINS! The verocity and vigor of the baked goods kingdom, not a day goes by where the muffin doesn't stand atop the throne of taste and desire. These choc chip muffins know exactly where on the food chain they lie, a soft fluffy top, <i>my god,</i> a rich chocolaty center, still <b>HOT</b> from the stove. Move to the top again and they are engorged with dotted choc chips still weeping chocolatey goodness</p>
